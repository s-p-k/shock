# Description
  shock is a small package to simulate logic gates and circuits. Currently,
  `and', `not' and `or' are the only gates available. shock is written to work
  with the chicken Scheme[1] implementation.


# Loading shock to your Scheme
After cloning the repo, you can load shock to your chicken interpreter with:

  > (load "/path/to/shock.scm")
  ; loading shock.scm ...
  loaded shock successfully

# Simulating gates
  You can simulate a 2-input and gate by running:

  > (simulate-gate and-gate 2)

  and this should return:

  input: (#f #f) -----> #f
  input: (#t #f) -----> #f
  input: (#f #t) -----> #f
  input: (#t #t) -----> #t
  Simulation ended successfully.
